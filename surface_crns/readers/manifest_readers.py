def read_manifest(filename):
    '''
    Process a manifest file containing options for simulations, and returns a
    dictionary of those options. Options can be:

    1) Single-valued options of the form "FLAG = VALUE". These will be added
       directly to the options dictionary.

    or

    2) Special sections. Special sections include transition rule sections,
       initial state sections, and colormap sections. Sections start with a line
       starting with "!START_<section_name>" and ending with a line starting
       with "!END_<section_name>, where <section_name> is one of
       "TRANSITION_RULES", "INIT_STATE", or "COLORMAP", depending on the
       section. Each section has its own rules for parsing, as described in the
       functions below, and each returns a different data structure, which
       will be added to the options dictionary.

    or

    3) Include statements of the form "!INCLUDE FILENAME". Files with names
       declared in an include statement will be read as though they were in the
       manifest file at the position of the include statement.

    Lines beginning with "#" or "%" are considered comment lines.

    Return value: A dictionary of options.
